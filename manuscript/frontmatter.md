# Preface

## Stop Right There!

This book is full of bad ideas. It's wrong, it's mistaken, and in many cases it's so far from the truth that you'd be a fool to take it too seriously. I also believe it to be an important book if you're interested in how systems of people and machines learn at scale.

I simultaneously believe that if I do my job right, it very well may be one of the more important books you read in your career.

How can both of those things be true?

Because, at heart, learning is about mistakes. Mistakes lead to new ways of doing things which avoid future mistakes of that kind. Information is shared that we accept that prevents us from making mistakes in the first place. We create and consume yet more information that we misunderstand or misinterpret which either causes mistakes or accidentally prevents us from making mistakes, i.e. Selection bias. A good definition of an education is the establishment of lifelong habits that minimizes future mistakes and allows us to fail (and learn) in new and interesting ways. Success, in short, is defined by the lack of significant mistakes in whatever enterprise we're undertaking. Without mistakes there can be no learning.

Our society, our culture, our machines, our history. These are all ways of creating, moving, storing, processing, and using information so that large groups of people and/or machines _learn_. What we do with information determines whether we live or die, thrive or wither, both as individuals and in larger groups. _Data_ may exist out in the ether, bits of ones and zeros without context. _Information_, however, by definition exists only so far as it has real use to others, and that means learning.

Information and learning are inseparable.

I've been working on this for some time. Here's a review of my books so far, with this book listed last.

# Our story so far....

### Info-Ops

Philosophy is applied language. It's critical to understand that concept if you want to build the right thing, whether an automated skyscraper or non-profit organization. We create useful domains of solutioning using conversations, process, and documentation based on our shared values using behavior as a deliminator. We make our lives better right now by learning what worked and didn't work in the past. Each action we take to build the right thing is better than countless other actions we take building things right.

#### Our Team

- Socrates
- Wittgenstein 
- Chomsky/Sapir-Whorf

#### Our tools

- The dialectic
- Structured Analysis
- UML

### Info-Ops II

Technology is applied philosophy. It's critical to understand that concept if you want to build things right, whether it's a new science or a computer program. We create useful tools to explore and understand the universe around us based on rigorous and consistent application of philosophy inside a formal system. We make our code and and work life better right now by applying what we learned in book two to our code and processes. Each action we take to build things right is better than countless other actions we take learning about the universe around us.

#### Our team

- Newton
- Peirce
- Von Neumann

#### Our tools

- Programming languages
- New coding practices
- Architecting our own practices

### Info-Ops III
Learning is applied technology. It's critical to understand that concept if you want to build things that  learn at scale, whether a fast-growing startup or an army of intelligent robots. We create nimble adaptive systems of people or machines by applying the model of learning we're going to develop in a Bayesian or Frequentist framework. We make our systems of learning at scale better right now by applying the new and better model we've created in all of the books. Each action we take to habitually build systems that learn at scale is better than countless other actions we take teaching others what to think.

*Note: Of necessity we must talk about all sorts of sensitive topics: religion, politics, sexuality, and so forth. I have had to provide examples in order to do this. If the reader is able to determine my political or religious leanings through these examples I ask both their indulgence and forgiveness. Also, there is a brobignagian plethora of street vernacular and impolite invective. I also ask the reader's forgiveness here. My goal is primarily to communicate. I believe that's best done using as much of the natural rhythm and slang as possible and as little academic circumlocations as necessary.*
