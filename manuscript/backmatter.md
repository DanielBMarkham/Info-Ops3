{id: definition-multivariate}
multivariate
: lots of variables

{id: definition-consciousness}
consciousness
: that which acts and senses its environment, changing itself internally and using those changes to both predict and/or enforce actions and sensory responses in the future


{id: definition-life}
life
: bits of consciousness assembled inside a boundary, such that if the boundary is broken the bits of consciousness do not continue in the way they did before and never can resume that pattern afterwards. Two lifeforms (boundaries) side-by-side given the same input and environment will over time result in both a different number of bits of consciousness and a different pattern of acitivty inside the boundary, although many similarities may exist (similar lifeforms or species)


{id: definition-sentience}
sentience
: lifeforms that are able to reason in abstractions. The number instinct is one of the early abstractions that occur as sentience emerges

{id: definition-intelligence}
intelligence
: Sentient lifeforms able to reason in abstractions over a shared medium and over periods of time exceeding those of the individual lifeforms
