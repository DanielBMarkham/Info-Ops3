: that which acts and senses its environment, changing itself internally and using those changes to both predict and/or enforce actions and sensory responses in the future


{id: definition-life}
life
: bits of consciousness assembled inside a boundary, such that if the boundary is broken the bits of consciousness do not continue in the way they did before never resume that pattern afterwards. Two lifeforms (boundaries) side-by-side given the same input and environment will over time result in both a different number of bits of consciousness and a different pattern of acitivty inside the boundary, although many similarities may exist (similar lifeforms or species)


{id: definition-sentience}
sentience
: lifeforms that are able to reason in abstractions. The number instinct is one of the early abstractions that occur as sentience emerges

{id: definition-intelligence}
intelligence
: Sentient lifeforms able to reason in abstractions over a shared medium and over periods of time exceeding those of the individual lifeforms
