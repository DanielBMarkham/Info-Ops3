{id: definition-multivariate}
multivariate
: lots of variables

{id: definition-consciousness}
consciousness
: that which acts and senses its environment, changing itself internally and using those changes to both predict and/or enforce actions and sensory responses in the future


{id: definition-life}
life
: bits of consciousness assembled inside a boundary, such that if the boundary is broken the bits of consciousness do not continue in the way they did before never resume that pattern afterwards. Two lifeforms (boundaries) side-by-side given the same input and environment will over time result in both a different number of bits of consciousness and a different pattern of acitivty inside the boundary, although many similarities may exist (similar lifeforms or species)


{id: definition-sentience}
sentience
: lifeforms that are able to reason in abstractions. The number instinct is one of the early abstractions that occur as sentience emerges

{id: definition-intelligence}
intelligence
: Sentient lifeforms able to reason in abstractions over a shared medium and over periods of time exceeding those of the individual lifeforms

## Kooks and Cranks

Wiki defines a crank as a person who holds an unshakable belief that most of thier contemporareis consider to be false. The thing they believe is so wildly different than what the mainstream belive as to be generally considerd ludicrous. Cranks have various maneuvers they do to dismiss all evidence that contradicts what they believe, making any rational debate or discusison about why they may be wrong a futile effort.


"They laughed at Gallileo, they laughed at Edison, they laughed at Einstein. Yeah, but they also laughed at Bozo the Clown"

A crank is a form of kook, which is just some extremely weird person; strange, eccentric, or crazy. Kooks are just socially odd and laughable. Cransk have some mastermind underlying system to their being a kook, which they're very willing to explain at length but which resists any sort of change based on reasoning.

Hidden assumptions here:

- That there is some sort of mostly-universal system of what's really oddball or not
- That we as the observer know what that system is (as opposed to simply observing it or acting on it from the inside in an in-group, out-group manner)
- That we're able to identify whether this particula person is part of that universally-accepted system and not just restating it in a form we're unable to interpret
- That previous people have tried to reason with them to no avail
- That we have tried to reason with them at the desired depth to determine that they are both totally oddball and imperious to change

Each of these assumptions are problematic, and they seem to boil down to, "That person's weird. They believe wierd stuff. Instead of learning new stuff, they just keep repeating the same old mantra that they believe in without ever introspecting or changing for the better" (for some random degree of "better", we suppose)

These are all highly subjective qualatitive judgements. Looked at it from afar, this can easliy distill to simple in-group, out-group clanning.

Perhaps the correct identification is weird, mantra ideas, we don't like him. We seem to be able to reason about and predict things using a different system which he almost religiously rejects.

The discussion then becomes one about simplicity, repetition of phrases to assure oneself, likeability, and inability to either dive down to deeper levels of reasoning, or being able to consider the ways in wich they might be wrong in some way we can both agree on.

Maybe everybody's a kook or crank to somebody else about some area, the only question is whether it's done in a playful, accepting manner by both parties.

Kooks are folks that believe things we don't that we think are simple-minded and we don't like them.
