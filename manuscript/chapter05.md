# Cynefin and the Mind-Body Problem

## Cynefin

## Simpson's Paradox


Boyd's management model

- learning is being wrong
- learning is not never about text, it's always about doing (but text can get you started at a higher level than before)
text exists as placeholders for concepts we may or may not know. It's impossible for the sender our livesk, the same words have vasly diferent meanings in different contexts, and the foundations of these concepts are continually changing over time
- learning is about being wrong (doing) inside an adaptive system (learning is management/evolution)
- Feedback loops are what we call these adaptive systems in action. What we call feedback loops are webs of interaction
- leraning is sequential and recursive

books. transferring learning to another using words is not learning. see-do-practice is learning. text can get you started but that's all

Learning exists along a spectrum
the unknown of the unrepresentable
chaos
compliated
complex
the unknown of the taken-for-granted
begins and ends with zero sensory input
along the way, both sensors and small systems are used
language is infiniitely abstractable and hierarchical
we get language for a thing when it moves from unknown of the unrepresentable to chaos
math helps us the last of the way
at some point, it's all automated and mathematical and it disappears because nobody thinks of it

Learning comes in two ways
language
formal systems


everything's always a mix

learning can exist in the purely abstract and the purely abstract language or the purely concrete math
